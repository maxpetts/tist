# Tist â†’ T ~~odo L~~ ist

A simple todo list app, written in Swift; developed and targetted for MacOS and iOS - _hopefully_.

This is my first time using Swift, UIKit and developing for any Apple platform.

# Todo

 - [ ] Persistant storage of todo items
 - [ ] Keep completed tasks & show beneath current tasks
 - [ ] Swipe gestures -> [ pullDown  : Create new, 
			   pullLeft  : Complete,
			   pullRight : Delete 	  ]
 - [ ] No tasks view -> Congrats or Tap to input new task
 - [ ] Add hotkeys -> [ / : to focus on task input ]
